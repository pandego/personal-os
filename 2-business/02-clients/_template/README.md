# Client Folder Template

This folder is the canonical structure for every client engagement. Copy it when creating a new client directory and replace placeholders with client-specific details.

## What Goes Where
- `01-contracts/` — Signed agreements, scopes, SOWs, invoices, NDAs.
- `02-docs/` — Project docs, research, planning, briefs, specs, and final deliverables.
- `03-notes/` — Meeting notes, decision logs, and ongoing updates.
- `04-personas/` — Stakeholder profiles, user personas, org charts, and key contact context.
- `05-code/` — Linked repos, submodules, or code snapshots tied to the engagement.

## Naming Conventions
- Folder names are fixed; keep the numeric prefixes.
- Files use `YYYY-MM-DD_slug.md` where appropriate.
- Use lowercase with dashes for slugs.

## Quick Start
1. Duplicate this template folder.
2. Rename the folder to the client name (lowercase, dashes).
3. Add a high-level client overview at the top of each major doc in `02-docs/`.
4. Record decisions and meeting notes in `03-notes/`.
