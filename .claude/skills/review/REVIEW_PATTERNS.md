# Review Patterns

Quality standards and patterns for generating effective reviews.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Concrete Over Vague

**Good:**
- "Shipped auth feature with OAuth2 integration"
- "Published 3 blog posts on AI agents"
- "Closed deal with AstraZeneca"

**Bad:**
- "Made progress on the project"
- "Worked on content"
- "Had productive meetings"

### 2. Honest Assessment

- Don't inflate accomplishments
- Don't minimize failures
- "Partial" is a valid outcome
- "Not done" needs explanation, not excuses

### 3. Forward-Looking Connection

Every learning should hint at future action:
- "Learned that morning deep work is most productive → Block mornings next week"
- "Realized scope creep killed timeline → Add explicit scope section to proposals"

### 4. Concise Bullets

- One idea per bullet
- No paragraph blocks in bullet lists
- Details go in sub-bullets if needed

## Section-Specific Patterns

### Highlights

The 2-3 things that mattered most. Not a task list.

**Pattern:** [Achievement] + [why it matters]

```markdown
## Highlights
- Launched new client onboarding flow — first revenue from automation
- Published "Thread Engineering" post — 50% more engagement than average
- Cleared 3-week backlog — mental space restored
```

### Goals & Outcomes

Track against what was planned. Be specific about status.

**Pattern:** Goal → Outcome → Notes

```markdown
## Goals & Outcomes
- **Goal:** Ship v2 of dashboard
  - **Outcome:** Partial — core features done, polish deferred
  - **Notes:** Blocked by API rate limits mid-week

- **Goal:** Publish 2 blog posts
  - **Outcome:** Achieved — published Mon and Thu
  - **Notes:** Batch writing on Sunday worked well
```

### What Went Well / Didn't Go Well

Focus on *why* things worked or didn't. Identify patterns.

**Good "Went Well":**
- "Time-blocking morning for deep work → finished spec 2 days early"
- "Weekly client check-in → caught scope issue before it grew"

**Good "Didn't Go Well":**
- "Context switching between projects → neither progressed meaningfully"
- "Skipped planning on Monday → reactive all week"

### Blockers

Only include actual blockers, not minor friction.

**Pattern:** Blocker → Impact → Resolution

```markdown
## Blockers
- **Blocker:** Waiting on legal review for contract
  - **Impact:** Delayed project start by 5 days
  - **Resolution:** Escalated to VP, resolved Thu
```

### Learnings

Insights worth remembering. Connect to action when possible.

**Good:**
- "Async video updates > meetings for status"
- "Saying no to one thing = saying yes to focus"
- "Energy management > time management"

### Next Week Priorities

3-5 outcomes, not activities. Verb + outcome format.

**Good:**
- "Ship auth feature to staging"
- "Publish LinkedIn post on prompt engineering"
- "Close proposal for new client"

**Bad:**
- "Work on auth"
- "Write content"
- "Client stuff"

### Next Actions

Specific, physical actions. Can be done without further planning.

**Good:**
- "Draft intro section of blog post"
- "Email John timeline questions"
- "Review PR #234"

**Bad:**
- "Make progress"
- "Figure out approach"
- "Follow up"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Task Dump
Listing every completed task without hierarchy or meaning.
→ Curate. Highlight what mattered.

### 2. Vague Reflection
"It was a good week" without specifics.
→ What made it good? What evidence?

### 3. Excuse Making
"Didn't finish because..." with external blame.
→ What could YOU have done differently?

### 4. Over-Planning
15 priorities for next week.
→ 3-5 max. Focus enables execution.

### 5. No Connection
Learnings that don't connect to future behavior.
→ Every insight should hint at action.

## Tone Guidelines

- **Direct**: State facts, not feelings about facts
- **Honest**: Acknowledge failures without drama
- **Constructive**: Problems include paths forward
- **Concise**: Respect your future self's time

---

## Data Quality

When pulling from Todoist/KANBAN:

- **Deduplicate**: Same task in both sources = one mention
- **Categorize**: Group by project or theme
- **Prioritize**: Lead with high-impact items
- **Count**: Include numbers where meaningful ("12 tasks", "3 posts")

---

## Review Hygiene

- Complete reviews within 48 hours of period end
- Don't over-edit — capture while fresh
- Mark unclear items rather than inventing
- Reference previous review for continuity
